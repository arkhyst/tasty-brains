## Overview
*Tasty Brains* is a **spooky cooking-survival game prototype** developed under strict **Game Jam constraints**. Players must prepare grotesque dishes under pressure, managing limited resources, time, and increasingly absurd demands. The project was conceived, designed, and implemented in a very short timeframe, prioritizing **core mechanics, tone, and experimentation** over polish or long-term scalability.

The development lasted for **3 days**, and the team was composed by **2 people**.

## Design goals
- **Clear core loop**: cook, manage, survive.  
- **Strong theme execution**: horror-comedy through visuals, sound, and mechanics.  
- **Rapid iteration**: mechanics built to be tested and adjusted quickly.  
- **Playable completeness**: a full experience within the limits of the jam timeframe.

## Game pillars (high level)
- **Cooking under pressure:** prepare unsettling recipes with limited time and tools.  
- **Resource management:** balance ingredients, actions, and risk.  
- **Atmosphere:** spooky tone achieved through art direction and sound rather than complexity.  
- **Constraint-driven design:** mechanics shaped by time limits and scope restrictions.

## Current status
- **Stable:** v0.1.  
- **In Development:** not a confirmed release yet, but we are planning on developing a comercial version of this game.
